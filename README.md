![National Park Trail](National_park.png)  

Descriptive analysis performed on data from the US National Parks Service about 
endangered species in the Bryce National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park,
Yellowstone National Park and Yosemite National Park with the goal of identifying 
if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

The most common numerical measures of frequency were derived from the data. In 
addition, some were visualized in violin plots, a stacked bar chart and pie charts.
The task and data is from the Codecademy 2021 Data Science syllabus.
